## 📊 Data Flow Example

**User Journey:**

1. **Morning (8 AM):**
   ```
   User opens app
   → Modal: "Good morning! How did you sleep?"
   → User: Sleep = 7 hours, Quality = 4/5, Mood = 7/10, Energy = 6/10
   → Submit to /api/check-in/submit
   → Save to DailyCheckIn table (morningComplete = true)
   → Show: "Great! Check back tonight to complete your day."
   ```

2. **Evening (8 PM):**
   ```
   User returns
   → Modal: "How was your day?"
   → User: Day rating = 8/10, Exercise = 30 min, Stress = 4/10, Gratitude = "Good conversation with friend"
   → Submit to /api/check-in/submit (update existing record)
   → Save to DailyCheckIn (eveningComplete = true)
   → Trigger ML risk assessment
   → Generate MentalHealthSnapshot
   → Match interventions from database
   → Create InterventionRecommendations
   → Show: "Based on your day, we recommend: 1. Try a 10-min meditation 2. Message your friend tomorrow"
   ```

3. **Next Morning:**
   ```
   User opens app
   → Show yesterday's insights
   → Ask: "Did you try meditation yesterday?"
   → User: "Yes, it helped! 4/5 stars"
   → Update InterventionRecommendation.effectiveness
   → Update UserPreference.effectiveStrategies += ["meditation"]
   → Next recommendation will prioritize meditation
   → Start new check-in cycle
   ```
