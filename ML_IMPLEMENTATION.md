### 4. **Crisis Detection Model**
**Purpose**: Real-time detection of mental health crisis signals

**Detection Criteria**:
- Severe quiz scores (PHQ-9 ≥ 20, GAD-7 ≥ 15)
- Rapid score deterioration
- High-risk keywords in chatbot conversations
- Prolonged inactivity after high-risk assessment

**Output**: Immediate alert with recommended actions

**Technology**: Rule-based + Sentiment Analysis
