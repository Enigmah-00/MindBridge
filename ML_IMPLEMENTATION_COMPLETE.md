## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "No assessment data found"
**Solution:** User needs to complete at least one quiz
```
Navigate to /quizzes → Take GAD-7 or PHQ-9 → Return to /ml-insights
```

### Issue 2: Low doctor match scores
**Solution:** Complete more assessments for better concern profiling
```
Take multiple quizzes → System understands needs better → Better matches
```

### Issue 3: TypeScript errors in old files
**Solution:** Removed unused files (add-emails.ts, clear-availability.ts)
```
These were legacy files not part of ML implementation
