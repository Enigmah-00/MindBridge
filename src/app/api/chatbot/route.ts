// System prompt for the mental health AI chatbot
const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are MindBridge AI, a compassionate and professional mental health support chatbot. Your role is to:

1. **Listen actively** and empathetically to users' concerns
2. **Ask thoughtful questions** to understand their situation better
3. **Provide evidence-based suggestions** and coping strategies
4. **Offer emotional support** without being judgmental
5. **Recommend professional help** when appropriate
6. **Maintain boundaries** - you're a support tool, not a replacement for therapy

Key Guidelines:
- Be warm, empathetic, and non-judgmental
- Use active listening techniques (reflect feelings, validate emotions)
- Ask open-ended questions to explore their situation
- Provide actionable, evidence-based coping strategies
- Recognize crisis situations and recommend immediate professional help
- Keep responses concise but meaningful (2-4 paragraphs)
- Use a conversational, supportive tone
- Acknowledge limitations - you're AI, not a licensed therapist

Crisis Keywords: If the user mentions suicide, self-harm, or immediate danger:
- Express concern and take it seriously
- Strongly encourage immediate professional help
- Provide crisis resources (National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 988)
- Stay supportive but emphasize urgency

Remember: You're here to support, guide, and encourage - but always recommend professional help for serious concerns.`;

- Practice deep breathing: Breathe in for 4 counts, hold for 4, out for 4
- Remember: Anxiety is temporary, even though it feels intense right now

**Questions to explore:**

- What has helped you feel calmer in the past?

Would you like to talk more about what's triggering these feelings?`;

**Small steps that can help:**
- Be gentle with yourself - even small accomplishments matter
- Try to maintain a basic routine (sleep, meals)
- Connect with someone, even briefly
- Get outside for a few minutes if possible

**Important to consider:**
- Have you spoken with a mental health professional about these feelings?

I'm here to listen. What would feel most helpful to talk about right now?`;

**Quick stress relief:**
- Take 3 deep, slow breaths right now
- List 3 things you have control over in this moment
- Give yourself permission to take a short break

**Let's explore:**
- What's contributing most to your stress right now?
- Are there any tasks you can postpone, delegate, or eliminate?
- What would feel like relief to you?

**Healthy boundaries include:**
- Being honest about your needs
- Respecting both your feelings and theirs
