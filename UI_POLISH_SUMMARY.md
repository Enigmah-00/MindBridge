# UI Polish - Professional & Sleek Design

## Overview
Transformed MindBridge from a gradient-heavy, glowing design to a clean, professional, and modern interface that emphasizes usability and sophistication.

## Design Philosophy
- **Professional First**: Minimal gradients, subtle shadows, clean lines
- **Corporate Aesthetic**: Business-appropriate while maintaining warmth
- **Sleek & Modern**: Contemporary design without excessive flourishes
- **High Contrast**: Better readability with clear text hierarchies
- **Consistent Spacing**: Uniform padding and margins throughout
