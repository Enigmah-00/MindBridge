  "category": "Depression"
}
```

**Status:** ✅ Enhanced API with metadata

### 6. **Doctor Search - Nearby Functionality** ✅
**Current Implementation:**
The `/api/doctors/suggest` endpoint ALREADY supports nearby doctor search:
- ✅ Accepts latitude/longitude parameters
- ✅ Accepts maxKm (maximum distance)
- ✅ Uses Haversine formula for distance calculation
- ✅ Returns doctors sorted by distance
- ✅ Includes specialties matching user concerns

**Example Usage:**
```
GET /api/doctors/suggest?lat=23.869&lng=90.413&maxKm=50
```

**Frontend:** The `/doctors/suggest` page uses this API and displays results

**Status:** ✅ Nearby doctor search is working
