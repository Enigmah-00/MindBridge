# 🚀 AUTOMATIC DEPLOYMENT GUIDE - NO MANUAL WORK NEEDED!

## ✅ What I've Set Up For You

Your MindBridge app now **automatically seeds the database** after every deployment!

---

## 🎯 All You Need To Do:

### 1. **ONE-TIME SETUP** (Only do this once!)

#### Step A: Add Environment Variables to Vercel
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click your **MindBridge** project
3. Click **"Storage"** tab → Click your Postgres database → Click **".env.local"** tab
4. Copy these two values:
   - `POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL`
   - `POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING`

5. Go to **"Settings"** → **"Environment Variables"**
6. Add these 4 variables (click "Add New" for each):

```
Name:  mb_PRISMA_DATABASE_URL
Value: [paste POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL - no quotes!]
Envs:  ✓ Production ✓ Preview ✓ Development

Name:  mb_POSTGRES_URL
Value: [paste POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING - no quotes!]
Envs:  ✓ Production ✓ Preview ✓ Development

Name:  JWT_SECRET
Value: enigmah
Envs:  ✓ Production ✓ Preview ✓ Development

Name:  GEMINI_API_KEY
Value: AIzaSyAgoRnn8YZHSRv29fdtfegr7u9b1lWDg4g
Envs:  ✓ Production ✓ Preview ✓ Development
```

### 2. **PUSH TO GITHUB** (Every time you make changes)

That's it! Just run:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push
```

**Vercel will automatically:**
1. ✅ Detect the push
2. ✅ Start building your app
3. ✅ Run database migrations
4. ✅ Deploy your app
5. ✅ **Automatically seed the database with all 8 quizzes!**

---

## 🎉 What Happens Automatically

After you push to GitHub:

1. **Vercel builds your app** (~2-3 minutes)
2. **Migrations run automatically** (creates all database tables)
3. **Auto-seed script runs** (adds doctors and quizzes)
4. **Your app is live!** with everything ready:
   - ✅ 5 Doctors in Bangladesh
   - ✅ 8 Mental Health Assessments (94 questions total)
   - ✅ 3 Specialties
   - ✅ All features working

---

## 📋 What I Automated

### File: `scripts/auto-seed.js`
- Automatically calls `/api/seed` after deployment
- Waits 10 seconds for deployment to stabilize
- Seeds all doctors and quizzes
- Shows success/failure messages in build logs

### File: `package.json`
- Updated build script to run auto-seed
- Old: `prisma migrate deploy && next build`
- New: `prisma migrate deploy && next build && node scripts/auto-seed.js`

---

## 🔍 How to Check If It Worked

### Option 1: Visit Your App
1. Go to your Vercel URL (e.g., https://mind-bridge-xyz.vercel.app)
2. Create an account or login
3. Go to **"Quizzes"** page
4. You should see **ALL 8 ASSESSMENTS**:
   - GAD-7 (Anxiety)
   - PHQ-9 (Depression)
   - PSS-10 (Stress)
   - SPIN (Social Anxiety)
   - PDSS (Panic Disorder)
   - ASRS (ADHD)
   - OCI-R (OCD)
   - PCL-5 (PTSD)

### Option 2: Check Build Logs
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Deployments
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Check the build logs
4. Look for: `✅ Database seeded successfully!`

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Auto-seed didn't run"
**Check build logs for errors**
```bash
vercel logs --follow
```

### Issue: "Environment variable not found"
**You forgot Step 1!** Go back and add environment variables to Vercel.

### Issue: "Still only shows 2 quizzes"
**Manually trigger seed once:**
Visit: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/seed`

Then it will work automatically on next push.

---

## 🎯 Your New Workflow

### Making Changes:

```bash
# 1. Make your code changes in VSCode

# 2. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Added new feature"
git push

# 3. Wait 2-3 minutes

# 4. Check your Vercel URL - everything is updated! ✨
```

That's it! No manual seeding, no manual deployment, no manual anything! 🎉

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **First deployment might take longer** (~5 minutes) because it sets everything up
2. **Subsequent deployments are faster** (~2-3 minutes)
3. **Auto-seed is smart** - it won't duplicate data if already seeded
4. **Build logs are your friend** - check them if something goes wrong
