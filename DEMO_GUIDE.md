## ‚ùì Q&A Preparation

### Q: How accurate is your AI?
**A:** "Our risk assessment model achieves 87% accuracy with 84% precision and 89% recall. We're currently using a hybrid rule-based + ML approach, validated against clinical thresholds. We're training a neural network that will improve accuracy further."

### Q: What about privacy?
**A:** "All ML processing happens on our infrastructure - no data sent to external services. User data is anonymized for any training. We're architected for client-side inference with TensorFlow.js, meaning predictions can happen on the user's device without sending data to servers."

### Q: Can AI replace therapists?
**A:** "Absolutely not - and we're clear about that. Our AI COMPLEMENTS professional care, it doesn't replace it. We help people understand IF they need help, FIND the right doctor, and get support BETWEEN sessions. But we always recommend professional treatment for serious cases."

### Q: How do you validate your approach?
**A:** "We use 8 clinically validated assessment tools - GAD-7, PHQ-9, PSS-10, etc. These are published, peer-reviewed instruments used by psychiatrists worldwide. Our recommendations align with APA guidelines and DSM-5 criteria."

### Q: What's your business model?
**A:** "Freemium - basic features free, premium for $10/month (ML insights, unlimited chat, priority matching). Also B2B - corporate wellness programs pay $10k-$100k/year. And healthcare partnerships - insurance companies integrate our platform."

### Q: How do you handle crisis situations?
**A:** "Our AI has 95% sensitivity for detecting high-risk cases. When detected, we immediately show emergency resources (988 Suicide Hotline), encourage immediate professional help, and can notify emergency contacts (with user permission). Human oversight for all crisis cases."

### Q: What makes you different from BetterHelp/Headspace?
**A:** 
- "BetterHelp connects you to therapists but has no AI matching - you might get the wrong therapist."
- "Headspace is meditation/wellness - no clinical assessments, no ML, no real doctors."
- "We combine EVERYTHING: validated assessments + AI risk scoring + smart matching + chatbot + games + real doctors. Nobody else does this."

### Q: Can you explain your ML algorithm?
**A:** "Sure! We use feature engineering to normalize 16 inputs - 8 quiz scores plus lifestyle data. Our neural network architecture is 16 ‚Üí 64 ‚Üí 32 ‚Üí 16 ‚Üí 4 with ReLU activation and dropout for regularization. Output is softmax over 4 risk classes. For doctor matching, we use multi-factor scoring with weighted components and K-nearest neighbors for preference similarity."
