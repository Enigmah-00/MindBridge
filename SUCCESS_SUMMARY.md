## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Create API Structure
```bash
mkdir -p src/app/api/check-in/{submit,today,streak}
```

### 2. Create Component Structure
```bash
mkdir -p src/components/check-in
```

### 3. Implement First API Route
**File:** `/src/app/api/check-in/today/route.ts`

**Purpose:** Check if today's check-in exists

**Response:**
```json
{
  "checkIn": DailyCheckIn | null,
  "morningComplete": boolean,
  "eveningComplete": boolean
}
```

### 4. Build First Component
**File:** `/src/components/check-in/MorningCheckIn.tsx`

**Questions:**
1. How many hours did you sleep?
2. How was your sleep quality? (stars)
3. How's your mood this morning? (emoji scale)
4. How's your energy level? (gauge)
5. Did you take your medication? (checkbox)
