## üéâ Vision Statement

**MindBridge transforms mental health care from reactive crisis management to proactive wellness navigation.**

Like Google Maps revolutionized travel by making navigation automatic and personalized, MindBridge makes mental health support:
- **Constant** - Daily check-ins instead of monthly therapy
- **Adaptive** - Reroutes when your situation changes
- **Personalized** - Learns what works for YOU specifically
- **Safe** - Human escalation when AI detects danger

**We're not replacing therapists‚Äîwe're the GPS that helps people reach them.**

We're not diagnosing‚Äîwe're routing.  
We're not treating‚Äîwe're navigating.  
And when there's danger ahead, we immediately call in human help.

**Mental health shouldn't be a maze. It should be a guided journey.**

**Welcome to MindBridge.** üó∫Ô∏èüß†
